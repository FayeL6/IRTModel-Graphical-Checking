# Graphical Tools for Item Response Theory Model Assessment
This is an implement of graphical checking tools for IRT model discussed in [\<Graphical Tools for Item Response Theory Model Assessment\>](https://harvest.usask.ca/handle/10388/12919).

#### 1. R package: 
rstan, KernSmoothIRT

#### 2. IRT model assessment:
- simulate data from 2PL model or find a real data set
- fit data into three Item Response Theory models: Rasch, 2PL, 3PL
- use graphical tools to assess the performances of the models. The graphical tools include:
  - residual diagnostic plots based on Randomized Quantile Residual (RQR)
  - item characteristic curves (ICC) of a non-parametric model (Kernel Smoothing Model) and the posited parametric models

#### 3. Result
The images are presented in the folder *result*.
